This script convert a pdf to csv and then find the worker with the best salary/age ratio an print it out.

Note: The pdf use have some ascci (I assumed is ascci problem) problem with some letter or combination of them. For example "ff" or "n".
This a pdf problem and not a problem of the converter.
Also the pdf name "workersInfo.pdf" was taken from cloudTables webpage.
